# flightAnalytics
Initial implementation of an exploratory idea to understand the pricing dynamics of flights in India.
The current implementation scraps a very popular ecommerce website, and dumps the daily prices of flights in MySQL db to maintain a history.
Then this is used to understand how flight prices vary. Objective was to find answers of the following questions:
1)- Best period to book a flight to get cheapest price.
2)- Price variations of same time flight on different week days.
3)- In what months flight prices are cheap?
4)- What/why are some routes more cheaper?
